# CodeMentor: AI-Powered Code Assistance Platform

**CodeMentor** is an AI-driven software development assistant that automates and enhances key tasks like code translation, debugging, optimization, documentation, review, and explanation. It combines modern frontend/backend technologies with symbolic learning, Bayesian inference, and reinforcement learning to create a self-improving and explainable system for developers.

> ⚠️ This is a **public showcase version**. Full source code and implementation access is available upon request for academic or hiring purposes.

## 🔁 Learning and Feedback Loop

For every translation:
- 🧪 Original Python code is executed.
- ⚙️ Translated C++ code is compiled and executed.
- 📊 Outputs are compared.
- ➕ A **+1 or -1 reward** is assigned.
- 🔁 The Bayesian map is updated using:  
  `P_new = P_old + α * reward` (α = 0.1)
